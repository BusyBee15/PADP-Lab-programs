#### This repository contains PADP lab programs that I did as part of Parallel Archetecture and Distributed Programming course in 7th semester



Program 1. <br/>
a)Write an OpenMp program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm. <br/>
b)Write a MPI program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm. <br/> <br/>

Program 2 <br/>
Write an OpenMP program that computes a simple matrix-matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation. 
a) Illustrate the correctness of the program.  <br/>
b) Justify the inference when outer “for” loop is parallelized with and without using the explicit data scope variables. <br/><br/>

Program 3<br/>
A) Write an OpenMP program for Cache unfriendly sieve of Eratosthenes and Cache friendly Sieve of Eratosthenes for enumerating prime numbers upto N and prove the correctness. B)Write an OpenMP program for Cache unfriendly sieve of Eratosthenes and Cache friendly and parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes for enumerating prime numbers upto N and prove the correctness.<br/><br/>

Program 4<br/>
Write an OpenMP program to convert a color image to black and white image.                                                             
a) Demonstrate the performance of different scheduling techniques for varying chunk values      
b) Analyze the scheduling patterns by assigning a single color value for an image for each thread  <br/><br/>

Program 5<br/>
Write an MPI Program to demonstrate message passing. Send array of messages from other processes to root process.

Program 6<br/>
Write an OpenMP program for Word search in a file and illustrate the performance using different sizes of file.<br/><br/>

Program 7<br/>
CUDA Program to implement SAXPY.
